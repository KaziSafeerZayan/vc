    <h2>My history of programming</h2>
    <p>I have been learning computer science for  2 years. It all started in 2020 when the Covid-19 pandemic happened. In October my mother told me about a thing called coding. At first I thought it was a problem solving thing where There is a code and like a secret agent  sometimes need to unlock code I had to do it like that. I was really excited because I liked playing a secret agent role. That is when I got into it. I never stopped programming ever since. My typing speed also inceased through it</p>
